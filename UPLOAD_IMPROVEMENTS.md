# Upload Performance Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to fix slow upload issues and failures in the Resume Customizer Pro application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Slow uploads and timeouts** - Files were taking too long to upload and eventually failing
2. **Poor error handling** - Generic error messages that didn't help users understand what went wrong
3. **Redis connection failures** - Causing performance degradation when cache was unavailable
4. **Heavy DOCX processing blocking uploads** - Synchronous processing causing delays
5. **Poor user feedback** - Users didn't know what was happening during upload

## Backend Improvements

### 1. Express Server Timeout Configuration (`server/index.ts`)
- Added explicit HTTP server timeout settings (2 minutes)
- Prevents hanging requests that never complete
- Configured `server.keepAliveTimeout` and `server.headersTimeout`

### 2. Redis Cache Optimization (`server/services/redis.ts`)
- Reduced connection retry attempts from unlimited to 3
- Shortened connect timeout to 5 seconds for faster failure detection
- Added graceful error handling to prevent cache failures from blocking operations

### 3. DOCX Processing Background Jobs (`server/routes/routes.ts`)
- Moved heavy DOCX processing to background queue (Bull)
- Upload endpoint now returns immediately after basic validation
- Files are marked as "uploaded" initially, then "processed" after background job completes
- Added configurable threshold (`MAX_SYNC_DOCX_SIZE`) for when to use background processing

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better HTTP status code handling (413 for file too large, 429 for rate limiting, etc.)
- More descriptive error messages for different failure scenarios
- Proper timeout detection and messaging

## Frontend Improvements

### 1. Upload Progress Enhancement (`client/src/components/file-upload.tsx`)
- Faster progress animation for better perceived performance
- Different messaging when processing vs uploading
- Clear indication when files are being processed on server

### 2. Better Error Messages (`client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
- Specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
- Client-side timeout handling (2 minutes to match server)
- AbortController implementation to properly cancel hanging requests

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- More informative loading states
- Better visual feedback during different phases of upload
- Clearer messaging about background processing

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Maximum file size for synchronous DOCX processing (2MB recommended)
MAX_SYNC_DOCX_SIZE=2097152

# Redis configuration (optional - graceful degradation if not available)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

# Server timeouts
SERVER_TIMEOUT=120000  # 2 minutes
```

### File Size Limits
- Individual files: 50MB maximum
- Total upload batch: 100MB maximum
- Files larger than 2MB are processed in background

## Testing the Improvements

1. **Upload a small file (< 2MB)**: Should process synchronously and complete quickly
2. **Upload a large file (> 2MB)**: Should upload quickly, then process in background
3. **Upload multiple files**: Should handle batch uploads efficiently
4. **Test timeout scenarios**: Try with poor network - should timeout gracefully after 2 minutes
5. **Test error scenarios**: Try unsupported file types, oversized files, etc.

## Monitoring

### Server Logs
- Look for "Processing in background" messages for large files
- Redis connection errors should be logged but not block operations
- Upload timeouts and errors should be clearly logged

### Frontend
- Upload progress should animate smoothly
- Error messages should be specific and actionable
- Background processing should be clearly communicated to users

## Known Limitations

1. **Redis unavailable**: App runs in degraded mode without caching (this is by design)
2. **Very large files**: May still take time to upload over slow connections
3. **Background processing**: Users need to refresh to see when processing completes (could be improved with WebSockets)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time status updates**: WebSocket connection to show live processing status
2. **Upload resumption**: Ability to resume interrupted uploads
3. **Progress for large files**: Real upload progress from server
4. **Batch processing optimization**: More efficient handling of multiple large files
